This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an element of an array that is beyond its defined bounds.  The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` shows how to correctly handle array access. The solution includes checking the array index before accessing elements, or using safer methods to handle potential issues.  This is a frequent cause of runtime errors in Perl and understanding it is crucial for writing robust code.
